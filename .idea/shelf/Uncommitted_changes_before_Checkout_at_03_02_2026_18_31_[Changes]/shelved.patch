+## Lab 1 — Task 1
+
+### Benefits of signing commits
+Signed commits protect developers from impersonation and unauthorized changes.
+They help ensure that commits are created by verified authors and were not modified after signing.
+As a result, commit signing increases trust in shared repositories and preserves the authenticity and integrity of the commit history.
+
+### Why is commit signing important in DevOps workflows?
+DevOps workflows rely on automation, CI/CD pipelines, and collaboration between multiple stakeholders.
+Commit signing adds an extra layer of security by verifying the author of each change.
+This improves traceability, supports auditing, and helps ensure that only trusted and verified code is merged and deployed.
+
+### Evidence of successful SSH key setup and signed commit
+- An SSH signing key was generated and added to GitHub as a signing key
+- Git was configured to sign commits using SSH
+- A signed commit was pushed to the repository
+- GitHub displays the commit with a **Verified** badge
